He has gotten weaker since I last saw him.,
I would rather eat fruit than meat.,
Maybe this time they will get through to her.,
I will keep jumping till they tell me to stop.,
Do we want them to give this to us?,
They can either move toward the sea or go home.,
The queen will find a rock under some leaves.,
He wished he could rest underneath the tree.,
It is unlike anything I have ever seen.,
She likes to swim until the sunset.,
What goes up must come down.,
She used to love gazing upon the water.,
We argued about the forest versus the river.,
"Tomorrow morning, I will have traveled via boat.",
"If I were with him, I would annoy him.",
There was a wild animal deep within the cave.,
I shouldn't have left without eating first.,
"If you had taken another step, I would have laughed. ",
Any of the animals could have done this.,
She used to love anyone who gave her food.,
Does he think I had anything to do with that?,
"If you could go anywhere, where would you go?",
Both of us should dance instead of one.,
Please be certain before you run there.,
Each child should give and receive one gift.,
I thought she was either one or two years old.,
This is more than enough for her birthday.,
She waited for us every day that we were gone.,
He will say everyone has water if you ask.,
Everything in the forest is green today.,
Has she been everywhere in the world?,
There are few people I do not know here.,
This is the last time I will ever climb this tree.,
She will expect at least five gifts tomorrow.,
Why do I have less water than she does?,
There is little that he cannot do.,
I have many doubts about your new plan.,
She climbs trees more than he does. ,
That is the most pleased I've ever seen you.,
Much of my life has been full of happiness.,
Neither person had seen the mountains before.,
We cannot find the tree that is next to the river.,
There are no leaves on the trees this year.,
None of my friends are at home right now.,
Nothing is wrong with eating fruit.,
The forest is nowhere near the sea!,
We had only seen the forest once before.,
Hopefully several people show up today.,
It takes some courage to climb such a tall tree.,
"If somebody wants food, we will go to the forest.",
Is there something he wanted to say to them?,
They will find a home somewhere around here.,
That is exactly what I am talking about!,
"Whatever your favorite color is, mine is as well.",
She wouldn't remember which tree we visited.,
I will eat bread or fruit: whichever you prefer.,
A river flows through the valley.,
The setting sun reflecting off the water lights up the area with golden light.,
I sat on the rock and watched the sunset through the window.,
He spent last time on a mountain.,
The moon was appearing behind the clouds at the dark of midnight. ,
A fresh layer of snow covered the path.,
The moon dangles low and large in the dark sky.,
"The sun rose bright and fair, and the morning was without a cloud.",
"At sunset, the sky shaded from pink into dark red.",
Birds are singing in the tree.,
The bird landed gracefully on the water.,
The grass was covered with frost in the early morning.,
"The gentle rain was over, but drops were still falling from the trees.",
The rainbow formed a beautiful arc in the sky.,
That wide-eyed innocent look reminded him of a newborn baby.,
The leaves were floating gently down the river.,
She brought a handful of fruit from the forest.,
The air around him was cold like it was being iced.,
The bee came to dance on the flower.,
Allow in a cool night breeze.,
I have many far-off friends whom I never seen.,
I was glad to go back to the village to see my home and friends once more.,
"He has two younger siblings, a brother and a sister.",
Mom placed a pot of brightly colored flowers on the table.,
She returned to the meadow and sat down on the grass.,
"There was a small interesting rock beside the tree, on which there was a frog.",
He used to go out with his friends every night.,
"Across the way, warm sun light showed through the dense forest.",
The way a butterfly flutters from flower to flower is graceful.,
The flowers this year which bloomed in the early spring have stayed abundant.,
He waded out of the water and laid his socks and shirt on a rock in the sun to dry.,
Our last halt was under a wild berry push a short distance from the lake.,
"She looked up at the glowing clouds, from which snow had begun to fall again.",
Fruits of great variety are grown in the valley and foothills.,
The country has a beautiful sandy beach.,
She tossed her head back to stare at the stars.,
He was living on the hilltop with a flock of two hundred elk.,
The little boy was halfway to the lake when mom spoke to him.,
A single gentle rain makes the grass many shades greener.,
"There was nothing dangerous about the forest, except snakes and insects.",
"Below the falls, a large beautiful rainbow gave color to the rising mist.",
Everything is ready for the forest walk.,
He smelled the fragrance of wildflowers while walking on a path that led to the pond.,
The desert was basking in an orange sunset when they finally stopped.,
The birds flew to their nests in the evening.,
"Water was dripping from the trees, and the land was wet.",
Snow crunched under her feet and quickly soaked her gear.,
It was at the beginning of winter.,
"Nature was at her peak, blending the wild blooms with various shades of green.",
It lies in a hilly well-wooded landscape above the valley of the small river.,
The birds saw the little girl who was walking among the trees and flew down to greet her.,
She glanced down at the bird's nest in her hand.,
She studied the berry-like seeds that grew in a cluster at the top of the bush.,
"The yard of the super old house was completely covered with plants, rocks, and animals.",
There was not a breath of wind to stir the young leaves on the trees.,
"The climate is extremely hot and dry in summer, while the winter temperature is mild and pleasant.",
"When traveling through the countryside you see many inspiring mountains, streams, valleys, and lakes.",
It was so close to the sea that those who lived in it could hear the waves forever beating against the shore.,
The island is very picturesque with rolling green hills surrounded by glorious coastal scenery.,
The ocean breeze brought that familiar scent back.,
The warm sun shined on the tall powerful trees and drew out all their fragrance.,
It was very pleasant out in the shady woods.,
They were sitting around the fire and trying to keep each other warm.,
She opened her eyes and blinked at the sunlight streaming through the forest.,
An old man decides it's time to get a new rock for his collection.,
"One day in spring, three men were riding together along a country road.",
She walked for half an hour until the rain began to trickle through the tree tops.,
The soothing sound of water running over stones greeted them as they neared the creek.,
The old creaking tree spread a blanket of shade in the grass beside the pond.,
I love the beautiful spring because the budding trees and the blossoming flowers are so abundant.,
"Whenever my aunt comes to visit, she brings some good gifts for my family.",
He took his children far away to a green valley.,
I am pleased because I love the warm sunshine and the fragrant flowers.,
"After a while, they were riding around the side of a steep hill through tall grass.",
Old meadows provide a home for many colorful plants.,
The warm sun had melted most of the snow from the path.,
She glanced back over her shoulder at the huge rock on the hill.,
The sun peeked over the desert horizon to the east.,
Ahead was nothing but a narrow dirt path lined with mature trees and bushes.,
We shall all live together in a small place near one of the lakes beyond the forest.,
I took a scenic ride through the ever infinite land.,
He imagined the way the ocean breeze zipped straight into their tent.,
"In the evening, we would walk in the yard and catch the grasshoppers and butterflies.",
The sun set too early on that autumn day.,
The valleys within the hill ranges are fragrant with aromatic shrubs.,
He skipped a stone across the pond.,
"She glanced up at her friend, who was sitting against a tree watching her.",
Have you ever seen a rainbow?,
"Yesterday, I had a chance to view a rainbow.",
The rainbow was far and high but neither thick nor full.,
I will be lucky to see a rainbow again.,
This evening we might see a beautiful double rainbow.,
I heard the animals chewing grass.,
I looked at the many birds along the path.,
"The birds made short, high pitched sounds.",
I was very tired after the long day deep in the forest.,
We did not have enough energy to play games.,
"Still, we were asked to see how far we could throw these rocks.",
"He loudly counted one, two, three to start the game.",
We could dig some soil and build a mountain.,
We even jumped out because it was not very high.,
I just felt that we must again go to this forest for another fun time.,
It was too late when we came back home.,
"Later in the calm of the night, when you get a chance.",
I also saw the moon in the sky.,
"The stars looked very small, yet they did flicker.",
It's pretty hard to see stars on a cloudy day.,
Where did the stars and the moon go?,
I went to sleep late at night.,
What a pretty rabbit it is!,
She hopped out of her burrow.,
Her eyes look all around eagerly.,
She perches on her toes and keeps her ears sharp and steady.,
"There was a breeze, then the rain followed.",
"Like a hunter, she looks around.",
She licks her ears and rubs her paws.,
Then there seemed to be gold in the rock.,
"They do not stop or give up, and instead continue to go ahead.",
"Hence, they never stop, going on all day seemingly forever.",
The digging in the middle of the tunnel does not stop.,
"Even when one rabbit stops to rest, others take over and continue the process.",
"If it rains heavily, how can they continue?",
Then they will have to stay home.,
It rains.,
What should I do next?,
The day is ending.,
Sun is sinking and the moon is becoming visible.,
"So, the rabbit has to take shelter and go to sleep.",
It is still so dark.,
I woke up from my sleep to see the next bright day.,
I wonder why you hardly ever see that in real life.,
I told my friends about my dream.,
The sun rises and falls in a seemingly endless cycle.,
"Finally, there is no more moon for us to see.",
Where did the moon go?,
What is left but a tree containing endless fruit?,
"Yes please, let's do it!",
"Okay, if you think that is the best path.",
The bird seems to be flying upside down.,
I don't see why that tree needs to be so tall.,
I often lose myself in the beauty of the forest.,
"Since we last walked here, the tree has grown by quite a lot.",
"However, it would be a lot more interesting to just jump in ourselves.",
This is basically the way trees grow.,
Put in a good word for me.,
We will be together until the end.,
I love late night walks.,
Will you love me forever?,
She loves the color of the sky in the early morning.,
"The tree has black leaves, long, slender, and beautiful.",
Flowers roses grew all around the house.,
Look at that clear blue sky!,
Purple flowers everywhere!,
"The way he moved, he made it look so easy.",
The rain was falling down hard.,
How high can trees grow amongst other trees in the forest?,
Lower your voice.,
I was living on a big piece of land when I was young.,
That tree is pretty darn big.,
My imagination runs wild sometimes.,
The forest was full of wild flowers.,
The lake is calm today.,
Sitting still helps me stay calm when I am having a bad day.,
We wanted to get closer to the wild animals because they were so beautiful.,
Don't stand so close to the fire.,
The storm is far away from here thankfully.,
This is the oldest tree on the land.,
This forest is full of very old trees.,
"The season is currently changing, as you can see since the leaves are getting brown.",
It was as hard as rock.,
Sun is a huge source of energy.,
She felt energy rushing through her.,
"If you follow this dirt path that way, you will reach a small forest.",
I have good feeling about this.,
My father is a really good man.,
What is your sibling's name?,
"Go to sleep, sweet child.",
Family matters.,
Welcome to our small but loving family.,
"Peace be with you, friend.",
"One kiss, one hug and one smile is all that it takes.",
For two years I dreamed of climbing that mountain.,
Knock three times.,
Where is your favorite place?,
"He jumped around the field, trying to catch a butterfly.",
We need to dig a hole and plant this seed.,
Do you have a plan for the adventure?,
I could hear interesting sounds like a song traveling through the night across the beautiful sea.,
"If you look carefully around you, you will find beauty everywhere.",
Who do you see in the lake?,
Come and find me.,
Find your true path.,
She could not resist the call of the wild.,
Call me tomorrow.,
I hope so too.,
"Aside from being pretty, this flower is also rare.",
Rain is falling once again.,
"We must leave, otherwise we will snowed in.",
"It is very cold outside, hence I am wearing a coat.",
This was a rich forest a while ago.,
Go straight ahead and you will find it.,
She was hiding behind the giant bush.,
Birds are flying over the land.,
I will plant a tree right here.,
There are many animals in this forest.,
What is all this?,
This is totally my favorite place.,
May I have some water please?,
How long will this storm last?,
"In the middle of the forest, you can see an old log rotting away into the ground.",
Sunrise is one of the beautiful parts of the day.,
Let's stay here for an hour longer.,
Every year I go and walk by the lake.,
The bird is still sitting still on the branch.,
Don't wander off too far.,
Tell me if you can see the moon tonight.,
I was eating the fruit but then I decided that I want to eat something else.,
Who planted the big tree over there?,
What will happen to the grass when winter comes?,
I know where bunnies hide.,
I always wondered why water has no taste.,
How did you sleep?,
Sometimes I like to travel far away from home.,
Love is not just a word.,
"We must take care of this planet, to be honest.",
If I plant five trees maybe at least one will grow.,
I never saw such wonderful river in my entire life.,
"Over time, nature healed, and grass, trees and animals replaced the bare dirt.",
Sundown is another beautiful part of my day.,
I like to sit down on soft and bright green grass.,
Snow was falling all night and in the morning everything was white.,
Oceans are just too big!,
"Seven years ago, I saw a huge owl right there.",
We like swimming in the river.,
Stars shine bright tonight.,
A little wolf is playing with the wooden stick.,
Sand on this beach is totally black.,
"The light in the sky was blue and green, moving slowly, like magic.",
I can see the trees growing along the shore.,
"The air is crisp and fresh, and the night sky is clear.",
There is one last leaf left hanging from the barren tree.,
This summer my family is going on a long walk around the lake.,
One of his eyes was purple and the other one was blue.,
It seems like it used to rain almost every day when I was a child.,
The sea covers a larger part of the earth.,
"The bushes surround the forest, creating a boundary that protects the landscape.",
The bees love to suck on the nectar of flowers.,
"These type of red rocks are rarely found, you have to be extremeley patient while digging.",
Ocean waves were very high that day years back.,
"Dark clouds part, allowing the suns rays to enter once again.",
Sunshine in the northern part of the country seems a lot different from the south.,
Shrubs are pretty much always seen growing all over the forest floor.,
Did you ever climb up that super tall hill behind that one tree?,
"It's too far, we cannot walk there now, it's too late.",
"I like making this place mine, keeping it clean and fresh for anyone who comes by.",
"Look, the fire is blue right now, that is so cool!",
Have you ever tried making a fire all on your own?,
"You never actually see trees growing, they grow too slowly.",
And so I kept dreaming like it was real life.,
